### Hard-Coding the Grid: Parametric Frameworks for High-Stakes Operations.

345 Intelligence develops the "Intelligence Layer" for heavy infrastructure and energy sectors. We bridge the gap between **High-Level Public Commitments** and **Real-Time Field Execution** through modular, parametric data architecture.

## ⚡ The Philosophy: Beyond Descriptive BI

Traditional Business Intelligence tells you that you missed your target yesterday. **345 Intelligence** builds systems that ensure you hit your target tomorrow. 

Our frameworks are built on three core pillars:
1. **Parametric Logic:** Move away from hard-coded reports. Our models use a "Rule Engine" approach, allowing for real-time recalibration as field conditions change.
2. **Operational Certainty:** We focus on "Ahead/Behind" variance that allows leaders to course-correct *before* a public commitment is missed.
3. **Clean-Room Architecture:** All logic is built using portable, industry-standard patterns (Kimball, DAX, Tabular Editor) that integrate with existing Enterprise ERP and GIS systems.

## 🛠 Featured Framework: ReCalibrate™

**ReCalibrate** is our flagship target-tracking engine. It is designed to handle the volatility of high-voltage construction and utility operations.

* **Modular Mapping:** Connect any transactional data source to our standardized "Mapping Template."
* **Performance Feedback Loops:** Logic that automatically adjusts year-end forecasts based on the last 14/30/90 days of actual field performance.
* **What-If Engines:** Simulate the impact of resource shifts or material delays on long-term public goals.
