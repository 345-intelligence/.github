# 345 Intelligence | Resource Hub

This repository contains the code frameworks and architectural patterns for the **345 Methodology**—a logic-first approach to stabilizing real-time operational data.

### 📍 Project Links
* **The 345 Report (Newsletter):** [Link] - Deep dives into operational drift and data architecture.
* **The White Paper:** [Link] - Technical standards for the "Temporal Backbone."
* **Resource Library (Templates):** [Link] - Implementation kits for DAX, M, and SQL.

### 🛠️ Framework Tiers
These resources are organized by computational maturity to help solve "Target Drift" at different scales:

1. **The DAX Skeleton (Free):** Logic-first framework for prototyping and localized reporting.
2. **The ETL Pattern (M):** Logic hardened in Power Query for mid-market performance.
3. **The Warehouse Pattern (SQL):** Enterprise-grade views for high-scale, tool-agnostic infrastructure.

### 🧪 Research Note
All patterns are stress-tested against the public **Corporation Favorita (Ecuador)** retail dataset to ensure reliability at 100M+ row scale without using proprietary data.

*Independent research into universal data architectures.*
